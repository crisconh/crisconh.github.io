            Maryse Ceha work arises out of and in the making. Maryse’s work
            revolves around the pleasure of making, the wealth of possibilities
            inherent in the materials she uses and the power of the visual stories
            that reveal themselves to Maryse in the process of making. She is able
            to mine an abundantly rich source of possibilities, meaning and
            pictorial alternatives, while surfing on that wave of creative energy.
            Her work expresses the joy of making discoveries in the making
            process. By emerging herself in making art she discovers and
            translates a wealth of content. <br><br>Nevertheless, her work is the result
            of a total commitment to visualizing and thereby researching her
            world. Furthermore, there is a constant in everything she makes.
            Maryse has a fascination with water. For the beauty of the sea, for
            the light that slides in and over the water, for the reflections as
            the water reflects the light back and the silence when you are
            underwater. Water that gives life, that distorts coastlines, that
            always precedes the horizon. She describes this as follows:
          </div>
          <div class="briefing">
            <span>
              “As human beings we primarily inhabit the land. the water is an
              unknown world and I think that attracts me, the mystery and the
              speculations about what lies beneath the surface. The ocean, the
              water, is my calming place. I find comfort in the rhythm of the waves.
              seeing its vastness as our eyes scan the horizon. trying to comprehend
              its endlessness and feeling so small in the middle of its mighty
              endlessness. In the deep, sound dissolves into silence, leaving only
              the whispers of my own thoughts. I see the deep blue spreading all
              around me. this is the realms of sublime nothingness, where the
              boundaries between reality and dreams blur. There is something about
              getting so far from the world we know, without the distraction. My
              mind is free.”
            </span> <br><br><br>Maryse does not make illustrations. Her work
            isn’t a pictorial renderingof what she has seen. She is looking for
            abstract values. In this regard, sheis aligned with the traditions of
            artists such as Yves Klein and Mark Rothkowho introduced color as
            subjects in their own right and with the colorfield painterswho
            explored the power of color fields as new pictorial spaces. Maryse
            alsosucceeds in her work in conveying feelings of stillness, of awe at
            the mysteryof the universal.
