          Maryse Ceha work arises out of and in the making. Maryse’s work
          revolves around the pleasure of making, the wealth of possibilities
          inherent in the materials she uses and the power of the visual stories
          that reveal themselves to Maryse in the process of making. She is able
          to mine an abundantly rich source of possibilities, meaning and
          pictorial alternatives, while surfing on that wave of creative energy.
          Her work expresses the joy of making discoveries in the making
          process. By emerging herself in making art she discovers and
          translates a wealth of content. Nevertheless, her work is the result
          of a total commitment to visualizing and thereby researching her
          world. Furthermore, there is a constant in everything she makes.
          Maryse has a fascination with water. For the beauty of the sea, for
          the light that slides in and over the water, for the reflections as
          the water reflects the light back and the silence when you are
          underwater. Water that gives life, that distorts coastlines, that
          always precedes the horizon. She describes this as follows:
        </div>
        <div class="briefing">
          “As human beings we primarily inhabit the land. the water is an
          unknown world and I think that attracts me, the mystery and the
          speculations about what lies beneath the surface. The ocean, the
          water, is my calming place. I find comfort in the rhythm of the waves.
          seeing its vastness as our eyes scan the horizon. trying to comprehend
          its endlessness and feeling so small in the middle of its mighty
          endlessness. In the deep, sound dissolves into silence, leaving only
          the whispers of my own thoughts. I see the deep blue spreading all
          around me. this is the realms of sublime nothingness, where the
          boundaries between reality and dreams blur. There is something about
          getting so far from the world we know, without the distraction. My
          mind is free.” ‍ ‍ ‍ Maryse does not make illustrations. Her work
          isn’t a pictorial renderingof what she has seen. She is looking for
          abstract values. In this regard, sheis aligned with the traditions of
          artists such as Yves Klein and Mark Rothkowho introduced color as
          subjects in their own right and with the colorfield painterswho
          explored the power of color fields as new pictorial spaces. Maryse
          alsosucceeds in her work in conveying feelings of stillness, of awe at
          the mysteryof the universal.
